# Next Steps After Successful Build

Congratulations on getting your build working! Here's what to do next:

## 1. Start the System

```bash
# Start all containers in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

## 2. Verify All Services Are Running

```bash
# Check status of all containers
docker-compose ps

# View logs from all containers (add -f to follow logs)
docker-compose logs
```

## 3. Configure Oracle Connection

If you haven't already, update your `.env` file with correct Oracle credentials:

```bash
# Edit the environment file
nano .env

# Make sure these settings are correct:
DBT_ORACLE_USER=your_oracle_user
DBT_ORACLE_PASSWORD=your_oracle_password
DBT_ORACLE_HOST=your_oracle_host
DBT_ORACLE_PORT=1521
DBT_ORACLE_SERVICE=your_oracle_service
DBT_ORACLE_SCHEMA=GSOWA
```

## 4. Initialize the DBT Models

```bash
# Enter the DBT container
docker-compose exec dbt bash

# Test the Oracle connection
dbt debug

# Run the models to generate the initial CSV files
dbt run

# Exit the container
exit
```

## 5. Verify Ollama Setup

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
docker-compose exec ollama ollama list

# If you need to pull a model manually
docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull phi
```

## 6. Access the Dashboard

Open your web browser and go to:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000

The frontend will show the placeholder dashboard. The backend should respond with a welcome message if you visit the root URL.

## 7. Test the API Endpoints

You can test the backend API using curl or a tool like Postman:

```bash
# Check the API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Get list of tasks (may require authentication)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/tasks
```

## 8. Set Up Regular Data Refresh

The scheduler container should already be running and configured to refresh data every 2 hours. You can check its logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs scheduler
```

## 9. Next Development Steps

Now that your system is running, here's what to focus on next:

### For DBT Models
- Verify that the DBT models are correctly accessing your Oracle view
- Check the generated CSV files in the `data/exports` directory
- Customize models as needed for your specific schema

### For Backend
1. Implement the remaining API endpoints
2. Set up authentication
3. Connect to the CSV data files
4. Test LLM integration with Ollama

### For Frontend
1. Begin developing a proper React application
2. Connect it to the backend API endpoints
3. Implement the dashboard components (client list, task view, analytics)

## 10. Useful Commands for Development

```bash
# Restart a specific service after making changes
docker-compose restart backend

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Run DBT manually to refresh data
docker-compose exec dbt dbt run

# Access the shell in any container
docker-compose exec [service_name] bash

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild a specific service after making changes
docker-compose build backend
```

## 11. Monitoring the System

- Check logs regularly for errors
- Monitor the `data/exports` directory to ensure CSV files are being updated
- Watch Ollama logs to ensure LLM requests are being processed

## 12. Moving to Production

When you're ready to move to production:

1. Update your environment variables
2. Set up HTTPS with proper certificates
3. Implement proper backup procedures
4. Consider scaling options if needed

Let me know if you need help with any specific aspect of the system!
